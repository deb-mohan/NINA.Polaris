/// <summary>
/// Auto-focus service — port of the N.I.N.A. desktop algorithm (AFPORT).
///
/// The sweep first moves OUT by OffsetSteps*StepSize and samples OffsetSteps+1
/// points sweeping back IN; it then keeps adding ONE point at a time on
/// whichever side of the curve minimum has fewer than OffsetSteps trendline
/// points (<see cref="AutoFocusSweepPlanner"/>) — so a start far from focus
/// grows the missing arm instead of building a one-sided curve. Every point
/// carries a 1-sigma error (HFR spread across stars, pooled over frames) and
/// every fit weights by 1/σ²; a no-stars point is soft-rejected (measure 0,
/// σ=1000) so the fits ignore it while the planner still counts it. The final
/// position comes from the configured <see cref="AFCurveFittingMethod"/>
/// (default TrendHyperbolic: trendline intersection averaged with the
/// hyperbola minimum), validated by per-fit R² gates, a vertex-in-range
/// bounds check and the worse-than-start guard, with reattempts.
///
/// Run parameters resolve from the active rig's
/// <see cref="AutoFocusSettings"/>; any non-null <see cref="AutoFocusRequest"/>
/// field overrides per run (so sequenced/triggered runs finally follow the
/// operator's tuning instead of hardcoded defaults).
